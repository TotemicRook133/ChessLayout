We hope you enjoy using this simple chess layout created with Pygame. While it does not support actual gameplay, it can be a useful tool for chess enthusiasts, learners, or developers working on custom chess projects. I love playing chess, and since I was learning python, I thought of creating a chess board using python. Hope you will like it. If you have anything, feel free to ask me via `contact@adit.com.np`
